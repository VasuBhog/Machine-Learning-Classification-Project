# Machine Learning Classification Project
Classification using a deep learning network for identifying leaves

## Getting Started
I am using Matlab 2019a will also work for other versions as long as your have Deep Learning Toolbox.


## Background

In this project I will be creating and training a convolutional neural network for deep learning classifciation.
Convolutional neural networks are essential tools for deep learning, and are especially suited for image recognition.

#### Goal: Classify leaf images based on the data set "Leaf" using Convolutional Neural Network.

Understanding how to specify training and validation sets, and defining the network architecture is also something I would like to focus on.

Learning more about the importance of Image Input Layer, Convolutional Layer, Batch Normalization Layer, ReLU Layer, Max Pooling Layer, Fully Connected Layer, Softmax Layer, and the Classifcation Layer.

Matlab is quite useful in the regards of learning more about machine learning and deep learning network as it contains Deep Learning Toolbox which provides a framework for designing and implementing deep neural netowrks with algorithms, pretrained models, and applications.

I have another repository where you can see some other excercises I have done to practice learning Machine Learning problems and excercises @ Machine-Learning-Practice
